# Jack really likes his number five: the
#  trick here is that you have to multiply each number 
# by 5 raised to the number of digits of each numbers, so,
# for example:

# multiply(3) == 15 # 3 * 5¹
# multiply(10) == 250 # 10 * 5²
# multiply(200) == 25000 # 200 * 5³
# multiply(0) == 0 # 0 * 5¹
# multiply(-3) == -15 # -3 * 5¹

a = str(input("Enter a number:"))
t = a * 5**len(a)
print(int(a) * 5**len(a))
